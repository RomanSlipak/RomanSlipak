🧐 (14.04.2023) I'm 16 years old from Ukraine, I also have a nickname R.O.I.Z., which I use on YouTube and post my songs there, if anyone is interested, here it is (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4A7N6hVIY6cLoajVM-h-lw). 
I like to listen to music especially 凛として時雨, I'm writing a "scientific" book if you can say "scientific" 
book about the types of thinking, if anyone knows where you can post such a book, it would be great if you wrote me in the telegram "https://t.me/R_O_I_Z". I love games, even though I don't play them. I'm still in my 1st year of studying.
